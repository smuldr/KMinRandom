KMinRandom is a library that generates minimal instances of [Kotlin data classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html) for use in tests. A minimal implementation means:

* Nullable values will be null
* Collections will be empty collections
* Other supported values will be randomized

## Motivation
The goal of KMinRandom is to make tests more readable by making it easy to instantiate data classes. This eliminates the need to set properties unrelated to the logic that is being tested.

In Kotlin, easily instantiable classes could be achieved by adding default values to data classes. However, this adds the risk of DCs being instantiated without all required values being set. Furthermore, when an additional property with a default value is added to the DC, the compiler will not force you to set the value in each existing contructor invocation. 

## Example Usage

```kotlin
data class Car(val colour: String,
               val model: String,
               val speed: Int?,
               val manufacturer: Manufacturer) {
    fun isBlue() = colour == "blue"
}

data class Manufacturer(val name: String)

class ExampleTest {

    @Test
    fun `Without KMinRandom - isBlue() should return true when colour is blue`() {
        val car = Car(colour = "blue",
                model = "MODEL",
                speed = null,
                manufacturer = Manufacturer(
                        name = "MANUFACTURER_NAME"
                ))

        assertThat(car.isBlue()).isTrue()
    }

    @Test
    fun `With KMinRandom - isBlue() should return true when colour is blue`() {
        val car = Car::class.minRandom()
                .copy(colour = "blue")

        assertThat(car.isBlue()).isTrue()
    }
}
```
